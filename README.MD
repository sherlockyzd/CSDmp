# CSDmp: Conventional Stokesian Dynamics in mixed precision

This is a pedagogical code to demonstrate the Conventional Stokesian Dynamics algorithm, written in Fortran 90/95. 

The algorithm is described in this paper:
Durlofsky, L., Brady, J. F. & Bossis, G. Dynamic Simulation of Hydrodynamically Interacting Particles. Journal of Fluid Mechanics 180, 21â€“49 (1987).

The program relies on standard BLAS and LAPACK routines. Modify the makefile according to your software environment.

## Two input files are read by SD.X: conf.in and particles.in
### conf.in:
Set the timestep parameters and the background flow
### particles.in:
Set the initial particle id, position, and (fixed) external forcing

## Two output files are generated by SD.X: out.xyz and particles.out.data
### out.xyz:
Standard xyz file recording the location of each particle. This file can be visualized by VMD, pyMol, Paraview, etc.
### particles.out.data:
Human readable detailed data generated by SD.X
